===========
I am pubbot
===========

Really?
~~~~~~~

Ok not really. I am an implementation of the minecraft client protocol in python twisted. One day i will fuse with my irc loving counterpart and much fun will be had. Or everyone will leave the minecraft server and i'll die without ever being a whole pubbot :(

What is a 'pubbot' anyway?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not A, who! Jeez. Only the bestest bot you'll ever meet. Smarter than you and you won't forget it.

So. Minecraft.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What you have here is a Twisted Minecraft bot. It's only ever run on Linux and it comes with buildout so you can do this::

    $ python bootstrap.py
    $ bin/buildout buildout:username=MINECRAFT_ACCOUNT buildout:password=MINECRAFT_PASSWORD
    $ bin/pubbot start

I am now connecting to a server on localhost, yay!

How do I connect to a real server?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I don't trust you with my power. Sorry. If you are a clever one you should be able to figure it out from my buildout.cfg
